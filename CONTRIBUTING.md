# Welcome to Codinasion Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [`tools.codinasion.org`](https://tools.codinasion.org/) :sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)

## Getting started

Check to see what [types of contributions](types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you want to add or modify Codinasion content, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion-tools/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue template](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion-tools/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/search?q=is:open+user:codinasion&type=Issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

As a general rule, we accept assignment based contribution for `good first issue`. If you want to work on an issue, comment on the issue `!assign` and you will be auto assigned to the issue.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/codinasion-tools
```

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

```bash
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

#### Add Content

- Add or modify content in the respective file/folder. You can find more information about the content structure in the [:point_right: How To Contribute Guide](HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md)

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Make sure to add a descriptive commit message.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Codinasion team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Codinasion team thanks you :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [`tools.codinasion.org`](https://tools.codinasion.org/)
